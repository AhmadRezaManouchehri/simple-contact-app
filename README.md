# ***Hi dear developers!***

My name is ***AhmadReza Manouchehri***, I'm 24 years old and it is an honor to have you in my repo. In here I added a simple contact app with simple operations like add, search, delete and edit. I use react.js, sass and some other techs related to the web development in order to build this simple contact app. My goal was to improve my skills and knowledge. I hope you like this simple contact app.
